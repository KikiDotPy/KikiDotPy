# Hello, coders! üëãüèª

I'm a formal chef on my learning journey to be a web software developer.

I've finished [Harvard cs50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2021/fall/), achieving the comprehension of **C language**, **Python**, **SQL**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **Flask**, and **cybersecurity concepts**. I'm following [Open Source Society University's](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) computer science curriculum and a Full-Stack web developer Bootcamp to improve my back-end and frameworks knowledge while building and designing cool projects and contributing to Open Source!

I love videogame, books, boardgames, foods and movies. Also coffee.  
I love a lot coffee (occasionally I cheat on it with cup of delicious tea).


If you would like to discuss these things, you can join me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/KikiDotPy)! 

Feel free to ask anything or just say hello, I love being in the tech community and helping whenever I can.
