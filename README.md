# Hello, coders! üëãüèª

I'm learning and practicing to be a Sofware Dev one day. 
I'm on [Harvard cs50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2021/fall/) lessons, I've finished to dive down to C language and I'm starting Python 3. I'm excited to try out new projects and ideas! I also have some non-coding stuff that I update on occasion, for example some writings or tutorial.

I love videogame, boardgames, foods and movies. Also coffee. 
I love a lot coffee (occasionally I cheat on it with tea).

I work at [Telus International](https://www.telusinternational.com), too. If you would like to discuss these things, you can join me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/KikiDotPy)! 
Feel free to ask anything or just say hello
