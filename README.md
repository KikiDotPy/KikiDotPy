# Hello, coders! üëãüèª

I'm learning and practicing to be a Sofware Developer Engineer.
I'm on [Harvard cs50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2021/fall/) lectures, I've finished with **C language**, **Python**, **SQL** and I'm diving down **JavaScript**. At the same time I'm following [Open Source Society University's](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) computer science curriculum while building and design some personal projects!
   

I love videogame, boardgames, foods and movies. Also coffee.  
I love a lot coffee (occasionally I cheat on it with tea).

If you would like to discuss these things, you can join me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/KikiDotPy)! 
Feel free to ask anything or just say hello
